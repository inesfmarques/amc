The goal of this project is to develop a classifier based on Bayes Network learning, that serves as a disease diagnosis. We created a Java application that, given the patient's data as an input, it classifies the patient as sick, 1, or as healthy, 0. To this end, we created a weighted graph class and, by the Prim algorithm, we find a tree that maximizes the probability of the data sample. Given this tree, we learn the distributions of the observed frequencies that allow us to compute the probability of a certain tuple of features having a certain classification. The application returns the classification under the maximum likelihood estimator.
